## üõ†Ô∏è Development

> **Note:** These instructions are only for developers who want to modify the source code. If you just want to use the application, download the portable executable from the [Releases](https://github.com/spectralf/vibecoderscompanion/releases) page - no installation or prerequisites needed!

### Prerequisites for Development

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (v8 or higher)

### Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/spectralf/vibecoderscompanion.git
   cd vibecoderscompanion
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## üì¶ Building

> **Note:** These instructions are only for developers who want to create their own builds. End users can simply download the ready-to-use portable executable from the [Releases](https://github.com/spectralf/vibecoderscompanion/releases) page.

### Creating a Distribution Package

To build the application for distribution (requires Node.js and npm):

```bash
npm run build
```

### Creating a Portable Executable

To create a single portable .exe file that can be run without installation or prerequisites:

```bash
onefile.bat
```

The resulting executable can be shared with anyone - they won't need Node.js, npm, or any installation process to use it.
